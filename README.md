Create a simple web page using Flexbox

With the HTML and CSS skills I've learned through The Odin
Project so far I created a simple web page using flexbox to 
lay out the different sections on the page.

I started with a picture of a sample website and a list of
fonts, font colors, and background colors and created a web
page to match the given example as closely as I could. First 
I wrote the html, and then I added CSS properties for styling,
and then I used flexbox to arrange everything.
